Secret Number - PRIVACY POLICY

Welcome to the Secret Number app for Android!

This is my very first attempt at a real playable game app. I created it as a test case for how to build an app using the MIT app inventor. It does not collect any user data or anything.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. If any data is created by the you (the user), then I believe that data is stored on your device only. It can be simply erased by uninstalling the app.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely, The CatFace Cat the.catfacecat@gmail.com
